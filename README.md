##Aproach taken
Started by setting all the folders for the creation of the site html, css, and js. After be done with that i created my board in the html and css sow i could visualize the board game. After being done with the board i started with Js wirting the function that will make my game. At the end of not being able to solve the problems i had in my Js i started putting some extra things in html, css and Js to make it look better.

## MVP

* Randomize the ruppies around the board.
* when randomize make matching ruppies sow there isnt 1 left out.
* Make the ruppies clickable and add a switch function where it will let the player switch the ruppies that are right next to the ruppie he clicked.
* Lock the ruppies that are paired to each other.

##Technologies to be used
* HTML
* CSS
* JQuery
* Javascript

##Unsolved Problems
* I was still not able to make the pairs get locked after puting them together.
* Reset button has issues thanks to the radomizer still tryng to fix that.
